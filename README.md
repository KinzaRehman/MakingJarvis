# MakingJarvis
How were they able to make iron mans jarvis so functional? 
This is a follow along project created by Ryan John on youtube. I truly love Iron man and seeing his youtube channel inspired me. Theres so many qondeful ways we can use different libraries to create a system that interacts with you. Although, from his inital code I made alot of changes to fit to what I was looking for, It is a project still in works that I hope to complete and create a whole AI assistant. Just like Jarvis, siri and Alexa :) 
Please note I got alot of this from literature and research and its subject to change. I will continue learning and making changes as my knowledge on this subject matter grows. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :) <3
